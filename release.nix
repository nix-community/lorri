          Fix watcher not starting if the first nix build fails.

          We were not actually watching the nix file, only indirectly picking
          it up from the first nix build; so if that failed, we’d not watch any file.

          Now lorri will always add the `shell.nix` to the watchlist,
          ensuring it triggers a rebuild as soon as it is fixed again.

          The filter of filterSource is only respected for direct children of

          watched.

          builtins.readDir'ed paths are now not watched recursively, which should
          greatly reduce inotiy resource consumption.

          Rewrite the internal daemon socket protocol.

          This should be a purely internal change, but if you have been using
          `lorri internal stream-events` in your scripts, the json output might
          have changed. Since the command is internal and not yet stable,
          not much time was spent keeping it compatible, so beware.

          The `--socket-address` command to `lorri ping` was removed for now,
          since only having it for this command doesn’t make much sense, it
          looks like it was originally introduced for debugging purposes.
          In the long run we could add a `LORRI_SOCKET` environment variable.

          Fix `lorri direnv` triggering an unconditional rebuild every time it is run.

          After fixing up the build loop people suddenly started noticing that
          lorri was evaluating every time something ran `lorri direnv`, which
          could potentially be every time the user switched between buffers in
          the editor.

          This is not the intended behaviour, since we should run an
          unconditional build only the first time the project is added to the
          watcher, and after rely on the watcher to notify us of any file
          changes (or the user running `lorri internal ping` to force a
          rebuild).

          Fix the build loop.

          Previously, any change (for example a direnv ping or a change in the nix files)
          would add a new build invocation to the queue, and the builds would all be done
          one after the other.

          However, a new build will always use the *newest* state of the files anyway,
          so the CPU time spent on all the other builds will be wasted (and hog your processor).

          Now lorri will only
          1. finish the current build (if running)
          2. schedule at maximum one additional build if requested

          This should improve the resource use drastically in some situations.

          `lorri watch` now supports executing shellHooks.

          - shellHooks run inside `lorri watch`, and not in `direnv`

            This means they will execute only once, while inside the
            build sandbox.

            shellHooks are not to be used for starting services or
            printing text to the CLI, as these actions will not
            execute when the shell is entered.

          - Environment variables which are appended to the
            environment with Nixpkgs'
            addToSearchPathWithCustomDelimiter function will
            automatically be appended to the user's environment when
            entering the lorri shell.

            Notably, this means Go support.

            Many functions in Nixpkgs use

             - R libraries
